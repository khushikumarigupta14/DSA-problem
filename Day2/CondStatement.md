🔹 Conditional Statements in JavaScript
-  make decisions based on conditions
-  control flow of execution
  🔹 Types of Conditional Statements
1️⃣ if Statement
2️⃣ if...else Statement
3️⃣ if...else if...else Statement
4️⃣ switch Statement
5️⃣ Ternary Operator (? :)
✅ 1. if Statement
👉 Use when you want to run a block of code only if a condition is true.
✅ 2. if...else Statement
👉 Use when you want to run one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.
✅ 3. if...else if...else Statement
👉 Use when you need multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.
✅ 4. switch Statement
👉 Use when you have multiple cases to check and want cleaner code than multiple if...else if.
✅ 5. Ternary Operator (? :)
👉 Use when you have a simple if...else condition and want a shorter syntax.
1️⃣ Use if for a single condition.
2️⃣ Use if...else when there are two options.
3️⃣ Use if...else if...else for multiple conditions.
4️⃣ Use switch when checking multiple values of the same variable.
5️⃣ Use Ternary Operator (? :) for short conditions.

1️⃣ forEach() → Array Method (Higher-Order Function)
forEach() is a built-in method of the Array object.
It is a higher-order function because it takes a callback function as an argument.
It is used only on arrays.
used with arrays to execute a function for each element.
It does not return a new array (modifies or performs actions on existing elements).
`array.forEach(function(element, index, array) {
  // Code to execute
});
`
2️⃣ map() → Array Method (Higher-Order Function)
map() is an array method that creates a new array by applying a function to each element.
It is a higher-order function because it takes a callback function.
Unlike forEach(), it returns a new array.
