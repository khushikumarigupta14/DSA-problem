# JavaScript Loops

## 1. `for` Loop (Entry-Controlled)
ðŸ‘‰ Use when you **know** how many times to run the loop.


```
for (initialization; condition; increment / decrement) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

- for exmple
` for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}`

* let i = 1; â†’ Start i at 1.
* i <= 5; â†’ Run the loop as long as i is â‰¤ 5.
* i++ â†’ Increase i by 1 after each iteration
# 2. `while` loop(`entry controlled`)
 - ðŸ‘‰ Use when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.
# 3. `do...while` loop(`exit controlled`)
-ðŸ‘‰ Use when you need to execute the loop at least once, even if the condition is false.
`do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);
`
- The loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
# 4. `for...in` Loop (`Iterates Over Object Properties`)
`for (let key in object) {
  // Code to execute
}
`
# 5. `for...of` Loop (`Iterates Over Arrays & Strings`
)
`
for (let value of iterable) {
  // Code to execute
}
`
# 6. break Statement (Stops the Loop Early)
ðŸ‘‰ Use when you need to exit the loop before completion.
# 7. continue Statement (Skip an Iteration)
ðŸ‘‰ Use to skip an iteration and continue to the next one.
# 8. Nested Loops (Loop Inside Another Loop)
ðŸ‘‰ Use when you need to work with multiple dimensions (like a matrix).

âœ… Use for â†’ When you know how many times to run the loop.
âœ… Use while â†’ When you donâ€™t know the number of iterations.
âœ… Use do...while â†’ When the loop should run at least once.
âœ… Use for...in â†’ When looping through an object.
âœ… Use for...of â†’ When looping through an array or string.
