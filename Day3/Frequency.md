ðŸ“Œ Frequency in Math
In mathematics, frequency refers to the number of times a particular value appears in a data set. It is often used in statistics to analyze data distributions.

Types of Frequency
Absolute Frequency â€“ The actual count of occurrences of a value.
Example: In the data set [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5],

The number 4 appears 3 times â†’ Frequency of 4 = 3
Relative Frequency â€“ The proportion of a value's occurrence compared to the total number of values.
Formula:

RelativeÂ Frequency=FrequencyÂ ofÂ aÂ value/TotalÂ numberÂ ofÂ values
<!-- RelativeÂ Frequency= 
TotalÂ numberÂ ofÂ values
FrequencyÂ ofÂ aÂ value -->
â€‹
 
Example: In [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5],

Relative frequency of 4 = 3/7 = 0.428 (or 42.8%)
Cumulative Frequency â€“ The sum of the frequencies of all previous values in a data set.
Example: If the frequencies of numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 are (1, 2, 3, 1),

Cumulative frequency of 3 = 1 + 2 = 3
Cumulative frequency of 4 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
