# What is a Math Sequence?  
A **sequence** in mathematics is an ordered list of numbers that follow a specific pattern or rule.  
Each number in the sequence is called a **term**.  

## Types of Sequences  

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Sequence  
- **Each term is obtained by adding a fixed number** (common difference).  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d
  \]
- **Example:**  
  - Sequence: **2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...**  
  - Common difference **(d) = 3**  

### 2️⃣ Geometric Sequence  
- **Each term is obtained by multiplying by a fixed number** (common ratio).  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
  \]
- **Example:**  
  - Sequence: **2, 6, 18, 54, ...**  
  - Common ratio **(r) = 3**  

### 3️⃣ Fibonacci Sequence  
- **Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.**  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \quad F_1 = 0, F_2 = 1
  \]
- **Example:**  
  - Sequence: **0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...**  

### 4️⃣ Harmonic Sequence  
- **Each term is the reciprocal of an arithmetic sequence.**  
- **Example:**  
  - Sequence: **1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ...**  

### 5️⃣ Square & Cube Sequences  
- **Squares:** **1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...** (*n²*)  
- **Cubes:** **1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...** (*n³*)  

## Why Are Sequences Important?  
✅ Used in **mathematics**, **computer science**, **finance**, and **physics**  
✅ Help with **predicting patterns**, **solving equations**, and **programming logic**  
✅ Foundation for **series & calculus**
