// ✅ Getter & Setter Methods → Provide controlled access.
// ✅ Private Methods → Keep logic hidden.
// ✅ Async Methods → Handle asynchronous operations.
// ✅ Calling Methods → Methods can call each other.
// ✅ Method Overriding → Child class modifies a parent method.
// ✅ Method Chaining → Allows multiple calls in one line.
