// ðŸ›  What is Debugging in JavaScript?
// Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code. JavaScript provides several ways to debug, including:

// console.log() (Basic debugging)

// debugger; statement (Pauses execution)

// Chrome DevTools Debugger (Graphical interface)

// Node.js Debugger (CLI-based debugging)
// VS Code Debugger (Best for Node.js & frontend)

// ðŸ“Œ What is the debugger Statement?
// The debugger; statement pauses JavaScript execution at that point.

// Works in both browser (Chrome DevTools) and Node.js (VS Code Debugger).

// It helps inspect variables, call stack, and execution flow.
