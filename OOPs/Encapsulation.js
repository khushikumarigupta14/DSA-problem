// Encapsulation simply means hiding details and only showing what is necessary.

// here college is a class and streams are its objects
// The College acts as a class that contains multiple streams as its internal data.

// Each Stream (Science, Commerce, Arts) has its own private data, such as student lists and subjects.

// The College Administration allows only limited access to this data using defined methods (functions).
